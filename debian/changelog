greylock (0.3.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * index: switched to new page/key generation scheme, which includes null-byte in the names of internal objects stored in elliptics
  * cmake: added greylock config cmake file
  * Switched to ebucket project instead of internal bucket implementation. Fixed bug in remove() method (id/url update)
  * page: added iterator constructor which allows to use read_latest() instead of read()
  * index: added read-only index, moved index recovery into own function
  * index_directory: aded search query
  * server: use ribosome::vector_lock
  * Major refactoring. Switched to elliptics API instead of additional abstraction level for proper error handling and performance.
  * Added tool to index directory of go/cpp/hpp/c/h files or list of files. Tool performs 'dnet_usage main' search after each document has been indexed, this is needed to test monotonically increasing (or constant) number of returned search result.
  * Added tool to read and unpack page content
  * index: when updating page id, it should also update timestamp, so copy the whole key and change url if needed
  * spec: depend on ribosome-devel
  * spec: added elliptics-client-devel package
  * index: switched to new index format (with positions support) and new request/reply format
  * search: removed search client, use client.py instead
  * Switched to new indexing/searching HTTP API described in src/{index,search}.json files. It naturally supports attributes. So far only tex
  * t attributes are supported.
  * Added sec.nsec timestamps into indexes. We put it into string index, but there should also be numerical indexes. That's yet a to-be-imple
  * mented feature.
